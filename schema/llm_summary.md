# Graph Summary with LLM

## Overview
Our AI summary feature leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent analysis and natural language summaries based on query result and HIRN literature. This tool bridges the gap between raw graph query results and meaningful scientific insights.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Graph Summarization
- Converts graph query results into natural language descriptions
- Highlights key relationships and patterns in the data
- Provides context-aware summaries based on the query type

### Literature-Enhanced Responses
- Integrates relevant information from HIRN literature
- Cross-references graph data with published research
- Enriches summaries with citations and supporting evidence

### Templated Question Answering
- Responds to predefined question templates about graph data
- Offers consistent and structured analysis
- Supports common research queries such as:
  - Relationship analysis between entities
  - Statistical summaries of connections
  - Evidence-based explanations

## How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: The system receives a graph query and executes it against the database
2. **Context Assembly**: Relevant literature and metadata are gathered
3. **LLM Analysis**: The model processes the combined information
4. **Response Generation**: A coherent summary or answer is generated based on the template
