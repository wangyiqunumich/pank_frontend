[{"article": {"Pubdate": "1989-01-01", "Abstract": "Three lines of evidence suggest that the p53 gene and gene product may act as a negative regulator of growth or a tumor suppressor gene: (1) in several tumors of mice and humans, both of the p53 alleles have suffered mutations and in some cases large or complete deletions demonstrating a loss of function mutation. (2) The murine wild-type p53 gene can suppress transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts in cell culture by other oncogenes such as the adenovirus E1A plus ras genes. In rat embryo fibroblast cells transfected with the wild-type p53 gene, E1A and ras, the wild-type p53 gene either fails to express any RNA or only a mutant form of this p53 gene is selected for in culture. This is analogous (in cell culture) to the observations made in tumors (in vivo) discussed above. (3) Both the tumor suppressor gene, the retinoblastoma sensitivity gene or Rb and p53 are found in oligomeric protein complexes with the oncogene products of the DNA tumor viruses. Both the SV40 large T antigen and the adenovirus E1A plus E1B-55Kd proteins bind to, and presumably inactivate, these tumor suppressor activities which in turn contributes to cellular transformation. A set of point mutations, deletions or insertion mutations in the murine p53 gene localized between amino acid residues 120-270 (out of 390 amino acids) activate the p53 gene and gene product for cooperation with ras in transforming rat embryo fibroblast cells. The mutant p53 proteins produced by these transformed cells all have several properties in common; (1) a prolonged half-life, which is 20 min for the wild-type gene product to greater than 2 hr for the mutant proteins, (2) very high levels of p53 protein in these transformed cells, (3) a conformational change in the mutant p53 proteins, and (4) the binding of mutant p53 protein to the rat cellular heat shock protein, hsc70. These transformation activating mutations apparently act in a trans-dominant manner with the murine mutant p53, forming an oligomeric protein complex with the wild-type rat p53 proteins, resulting in the inactivation of the wild-type p53 function (rat p53).", "Authors": ["A J Levine"], "Title": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene and gene product.", "PubmedID": "2488233", "Source": "PubMed"}, "cited_by": 14}, {"article": {"Pubdate": "2003-01-01", "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene integrates numerous signals to control cell life and death. p53 and its function-related genes consists of a complicated gene network.

Its encoding wild-type p53 protein is composed of four parts: N-terminal activation domain, DNA-binding domain, oligomerization domain, and C-terminal regulation domain. As the gene structures of p73, p51, p63 are similar with p53, they are regarded as members of p53 gene family. p53 play an intermediate role connecting varied stress signals with the reactions of cells. DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, aberrant growth signals, or chemotherapeutic drugs may activate the p53 network. When expression of p53 elevated, p53-mdm2 and p14(ARF)-mdm2 feedback loops can accurately regulate the expression level of p53, and the cooperation of p33ING1b gene is also needed in the process of p53 exerting normal function. Phosphorylation and acelylation are two important mechanisms to modulate p53 activity in vivo. Several dozen downstream genes are controlled directly by p53, and the activity of p53 falls into four categories: cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis, genetic stability, and inhibition of blood vessel formation.

Mutations in the suppressor gen p53 are thought to be essential for cancer development. This gen is one of the most important regulators of transcription, cellular cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis detected till now. Inactivation of gene p53 leads to uncontrolled cell divisions, and further to transformation of normal cells into the carcinous ones. Observations that mutations in gene p53 appear under conditions of occupational and environmental exposures to chemical and physical carcinogens, such as vinyl chloride, radon, or aflatoxin B1, have proved to be of enormous importance for the occupational and environmental health. Changes in expression of gene p53, and also its mutations, cause variations of cellular protein p53 concentration. Higher cellular protein p53 levels are associated with increased protein transfer to the extracellular liquid and to blood. It has been observed that increased blood serum protein p53 concentrations may have a prognostic value in early diagnosis of lung cancer. The results of a number of studies confirm that accumulation of a mutated form of protein p53, and presumably also large quantities of wild forms of that protein in the cells, may be a factor that triggers the production of anti-p53 antibodies. Statistical analysis showed that anti-p53 antibodies can be regarded as a specific biomarker of cancer process. The prevalence of anti-p53 antibodies correlated with the degree of cancer malignancy.

At this multiplicity of infection, growth characteristics of lymphoma cell lines were not changed significantly. In contrast, cells transduced with wild-type p53 gene showed an inhibition of proliferation as well as an increase in apoptosis. Cell loss by apoptosis after p53 gene transfer was up to 40% as compared to transduction with an irrelevant vector. In addition, we determined the effects of DNA damage produced by the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide on wild-type p53 transfected lymphoma cells. In Ad-p53-transfected Raji cells, treatment with the drug resulted in a marked increase of cell loss in comparison to Ad-beta-Gal-transfected cells (45% vs. 77%).

In ameloblastomas, expression of p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) was significantly higher in plexiform cases than in follicular cases. Markedly decreased reactivity for p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) was detected in keratinizing and granular cells in ameloblastoma subtypes. Basal cell ameloblastoma showed slightly higher reactivity for p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) as compared with other subtypes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nElevated expression of p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) in benign and malignant ameloblastomas suggests that alteration of the p53-MDM2-p14(ARF) cascade is involved in oncogenesis and/of malignant transformation of odontogenic epithelium. p53 gene status implied that p53 mutation might play a minor role in neoplastic changes of odontogenic epithelium.

Increased frequency of p53 mutations has been generally observed in advanced stage CaP and metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. The significance of focal p53 immunostaining in primary CaP remains uncertain with respect to the p53 gene mutation or tumor progression. The goal of this study was to evaluate p53 gene mutations in focal regions of primary prostate cancers positive by p53 immunostaining.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWhole-mount prostates from men with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer were immunostained for p53 protein. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to harvest p53 positive cells from areas of tumor and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and benign gland.

Phase III trials in patients with head and neck cancer are ongoing, and a number of clinical trials in other cancer indications have been completed. INGN 201 is being reviewed by the EMEA for approval in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) under the provisions of exceptional circumstance; the therapy is available on a compassionate use basis to eligible LFS cancer patients under a protocol authorised by the US FDA. The p53 tumour suppressor gene is deleted or mutated in many tumour cells and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human tumours. The p53 protein is one of the most intricate elements in the apoptotic signalling cascade, and a mutation in the gene encoding it is believed to result in a decreased ability of a cell to apoptose. Thus replacing this gene via adenovirally-mediated p53 gene therapy is hoped to result in increased apoptosis where it is administered.INGN 201 is available for licensing, although Introgen favours retaining partial or full rights to the therapy in the US. Introgen entered into a license agreement with The University of Texas System and MD Anderson Cancer Center in 1994. The technologies licenced include p53 and fus1 (INGN 401). The collaboration has yielded exclusive patent and licensing rights to numerous technologies. Introgen entered into a collaboration with Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals (now sanofi-aventis) to develop therapeutics based on p53 inhibition in October 1994. However, in June 2001 this relationship was restructured and Introgen assumed responsibility for the worldwide development of all p53 products including INGN 201, and acquired all marketing and commercialisation rights with respect to those products. Introgen initiated two phase III trials in head and neck cancer (in June 2000 and May 2001) at about 80 sites in the US, Canada and Europe; the first is a comparative study of INGN 201 and IV methotrexate in 240 patients with refractory head and neck cancer. The second is for the combination of INGN 201 and standard chemotherapy, compared with standard chemotherapy alone, in 288 patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Introgen expects to complete regulatory filings for advanced recurrent head and neck cancer in the US and EU within 2007. Favourable phase II data of INGN 201 in a subpopulation of patients with recurrent, unresectable head and neck cancer (SCCHN) prompted Introgen to seek accelerated approval for INGN 201 in December 2004. The company has filed a request with the FDA to accept a 'rolling Biologics License Application', the first regulatory step in the accelerated approval process. Introgen requested immediate initiation of the Accelerated Approval rolling BLA, with completion of the filing process expected before the end of 2005. Introgen had presented combined results from three multicentre (US and Europe) phase II studies of INGN 201 in 217 patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck confirming previous safety and efficacy results of the treatment. In April 2004, the Southwest Oncology Group initiated a similar clinical trial using INGN 201 for the treatment of stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, or oropharynx, that is able to be removed surgically. The study assessed the feasibility, efficacy and safety of administering INGN 201 at the time of surgery for suppression of remaining tumour cells, followed by a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The previous trial was a phase II study that afforded Introgen access to surgical specialists in cancer and complemented the company's ongoing pivotal phase III studies in advanced recurrent disease. Sixty patients with head and neck cancer will undergo surgery at ten US sites and receive INGN 201 intraoperatively (and not postoperatively as used in the former trial) followed by a combination of chemo- and radiotherapy. In September 2003, INGN 201 was granted designation as a Fast Track Drug Product development programme by the FDA for prolonging survival and delaying time to disease progression in patients with recurrent, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Previously, in February 2003, INGN 201 received orphan drug designation from the FDA for head and neck cancer. Phase I trials in the US for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer have been completed. Sanofi-aventis (formerly Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer Gencell) initiated phase II trials in the US, Europe and Canada for non-small-cell lung cancer. Intratumoral injection of RPR/INGN 201 in patients with recurrent glioblastomas was safe and resulted in expression of the p53 protein. Direct administration of RPR/INGN 201 to the lower airways of patients with bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma resulted in symptomatic improvement and improved lung function in some patients. In November 2003, according to a Clinical Trials Agreement between the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Introgen, a 6-month phase I/II study with p53 gene therapy administered in the form of an oral rinse or mouthwash for patients with oral premalignancies has been initiated. This is the first trial to investigate the effect of this treatment on oral lesions that are at high risk for developing into full blown cancers. In September 2006, the EMEA granted orphan drug status to INGN 201 for the treatment of LFS, following Gendux's application for the designation. The company intends to provide the therapy on a compassionate use basis to qualifying patients in Europe.INGN 201 has been successfully used in the treatment of a LFS patient on a compassionate use basis under a protocol authorised by the FDA. Based on these interim findings, Introgen has decided to continue making the therapy available through a compassionate use programme to eligible LFS patients who have relapsed after standard treatment as part of physician-sponsored protocols at qualifying institutions in the US.A worldwide, exclusive license to a family of US patents covering a combination therapy comprised of INGN 201 in combination with several inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFr) such as Erbituxtrade mark Vectibixtrade mark and Tarcevatrade mark was granted to Introgen by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in November 2006. In February 2006, Introgen exclusively licenced a broad patent (US Patent No. 6 989 375), originally issued to to the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System; the patent covers any therapeutic gene-based therapy when applied in combination with conventional cancer therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy. Introgen Therapeutics was awarded a patent from the US Patent and Trademark Office in June 2005 that directly covers many of the special features of its INGN 201 molecular therapy. US Patent No. 6,905,873 is one of a family of patents that cover INGN 201 that have been issued to the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System and exclusively licensed to Introgen. To date, Introgen controls 30 issued patents relevant to the product covering compositions, therapeutic methods of administering the product in virtually any form, alone and in conjunction with the most widely used chemotherapeutic and radiation treatments, as well as its production, and has a large number of pending patent applications in the US and in foreign countries relating to its ADVEXIN((R)) therapy. In December 2004, the US Patent and Trademark Office issued Patent No. 6,830,749 entitled Recombinant p53 Adenovirus Methods and Compositions. Importantly, the patent is the broadest adenoviral p53 patent to date, covering any adenovirus carrying the p53 gene under the control of any promoter. Previously, Patent No. 6,805,858 covering methods for the administration of INGN 201 to cancer patients including virtually all of those routes currently being used for adenoviral delivery was awarded. In addition, US Patent No. 6,740,320, which broadly covers adenoviral vectors with the tumour suppressor p53 in pharmaceutical compositions, was awarded. This patent extends Introgen's patent coverage for its adenoviral p53 gene therapy product to the year 2021, not taking into account possible patent extensions. In February 2003, the US Patent and Trademark Office issued patent No. 6,511,847, entitled Recombinant p53 Adenovirus Methods and Compositions, covering any adenoviral DNA molecule that encodes the p53 gene positioned under the control of a promoter.US patents issued in 2002 include Patent No. 6,410,010, broadly covering all adenoviral p53 compositions (including ADVEXIN((R))) that express adequate p53 in amounts sufficient to suppress the growth of or kill cancer cells in patients. The patent also covers adenoviral p53, which incorporates a specific type of promoter that helps cells to express the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Introgen has a number of US patents that relate to the clinical use of adenoviral p53 gene therapy in cancer as monotherapy or in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation therapies or other agents that have a damaging effect on the DNA or survival of (i.e. 2-methoxyestradiol, Patent No. 6,410,029) cancer cells.A patent with broad claims directed to combination therapy with the p53 gene and conventional chemotherapy or radiation was issued in China in August 2005. Patent No. ZL95192776.0, entitled Compositions Comprising DNA Damaging Agents and p53, was issued to the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System and was exclusively licenced to Introgen.

The FAC expression activity per transformed cell was stimulated to an estimated level of 18- to 21-fold upon overexpression of p53. The tumor-derived p53 mutants, His175 and His273, that fail to bind DNA showed only a reduced stimulatory activity on FAC transcription.

To establish further the correlation between p53 gene alterations and progression of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), the authors analyzed both mutations and rearrangements of the p53 gene in a cohort of 84 NHLs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty-four NHLs were analyzed for p53 gene alterations. Point mutations of exons 5-9 were studied by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), and DNA rearrangements were studied by Southern blot analysis. RESULTS. Point mutations and DNA rearrangements of the p53 gene were detected in 6 (7.2%) and 3 (3.6%) patients, respectively. All p53 gene abnormalities were found exclusively in B-cell NHLs. Taken together, patients with p53 gene alterations had poorer survival than other patients (P = 0.024). However, of the three patients with p53 gene rearrangements, the two who appeared to have one normal allele showed a relatively better response to chemotherapy and had longer survival (27 and 47 months). In contrast, the remaining patient who had rearranged bands much stronger than the germline, and thus appeared to have both alleles rearranged, was refractory to chemotherapy and had poorer survival (6 months).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with NHLs of intermediate and high grades who carried point mutations or rearrangements of p53 genes had worse outcomes than other patients.

The p53 tumour suppressor gene is deleted or mutated in many tumour cells and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human tumours. INGN 201 has been shown to kill cancer cells directly. In August 2002, Introgen announced plans to file an application for INGN 201 with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer; the European filing will be submitted simultaneously with the previously scheduled (planned for 2004) submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for ADVEXIN to the US FDA. On 20 February 2003, INGN 201 received orphan drug designation from the US FDA for head and neck cancer. INGN 201 is available for licensing although Introgen favours retaining partial or full rights to the therapy in the US. Introgen Therapeutics and its collaborative partner for the p53 programme, Aventis Gencell, have been developing p53 gene therapy products. The agreement was originally signed by Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer's Gencell division, which became Aventis Gencell after Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer merged with Hoechst Marion Roussel to form Aventis Pharma. According to the original agreement, Introgen was responsible for phase I and preclinical development in North America, while Aventis Gencell was responsible for clinical trials conducted in Europe and for clinical trials in North America beyond phase I. In April 2001, Aventis Gencell and Introgen restructured their existing collaboration agreement for p53 gene therapy products. Aventis Gencell indicated that p53 research had suffered from internal competition for resources and was pulling back from its development agreement with Introgen for p53 gene therapy products. Introgen will assume responsibility for worldwide development of all p53 programmes and will obtain exclusive worldwide commercial rights to p53-based gene therapy products. Aventis Gencell will increase its equity stake in Introgen by investing $US 20 million in non-voting preferred shares of Introgen that will be convertible to Introgen common shares at a premium to the market price. Introgen will also receive a 5% equity stake in Aventis Gencell. Introgen intends to use the proceeds of Aventis Gencell's investment to fund the commercialisation of the p53 gene therapy product and to begin building its internal sales and marketing division to support the products anticipated market introduction. In April 2001, Aventis Pharma announced that it intended to spin off its gene therapy division, Aventis Gencell, as a separate operating company. In mid-2002, Aventis Pharma was still attempting to spin off Aventis Gencell but negotiations with venture capital partners had failed. Gene Logic (formerly OncorMed) of the US was contracted by Introgen to perform the p53 status testing for RPR/INGN 201 phase I clinical trials. In February 2003, Introgen announced it will streamline its phase III clinical trials for head and neck cancer to reduce spending, and that INGN 201 received Orphan Drug Status for head and neck cancer in the US. According to results (published in January 2003) of Introgen's phase II study of non-metastatic patients with non-small cell lung cancer (ineligible to receive surgery or combination therapy with radiation and cancer chemotherapy) treated with INGN 201 combined with radiation therapy, approximately 60% of patients' primary tumours regressed or disappeared after the combination therapy, as assessed by both biopsies and by CT scans 3 months after treatment. Investigators commented that further randomised trials are needed to follow-up on these observations. In February 2003, Introgen announced that it will move ahead with the development of registration plans for a non-small cell lung cancer indication for INGN 201, and is now including support for lung cancer registration in partnering discussions. RPR/INGN 201 is undergoing phase I trials for the potential treatment of lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, liver and brain cancers. Introgen and Aventis Pharma had signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). NCI will sponsor clinical trials to evaluate and develop RPR/INGN 201 as a potential anticancer agent for these cancer indications. The trials conducted under a NCI-sponsored IND will evaluate RPR/INGN 201 alone and in combination with other anticancer agents. This agreement was originally signed by Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer's Gencell. Introgen has completed three phase I clinical trials with INGN 201 in patients with bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma, ovarian cancer and recurrent glioblastomas, respectively. Intratumoural injection of RPR/INGN 201 in patients with recurrent glioblastomas was well tolerated and resulted in expression of the p53 protein. Direct administration of RPR/INGN 201 to the lower airways of patients with bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma resulted in symptomatic improvement and improved lung function in some patients. In February 2003, Introgen announced that the US Patent and Trademark Office has issued to The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, patent No. 6,511,847 entitled \"Recombinant p53 Adenovirus Methods and Compositions\". Introgen Therapeutics is the exclusive licensee of this patent. The patent covers any adenoviral DNA molecules that encode the p53 gene positioned under the control of a promoter. Such a DNA molecule forms the genetic core of Introgen's ADVEXIN cancer therapy. Introgen's ADVEXIN therapy is now covered by up to ten separate US patents relevant to the product including compositions, therapeutic methods of administering the product in virtually any form, alone and in conjunction with the most widely used chemotherapeutic and radiation treatments, as well as its production. Introgen has a number of US patents that relate to the clinical use of ADVEXIN in cancer as monotherapy or in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation therapies, or other agents that have a damaging effect on the DNA or survival of (i.e. 2-methoxyestradiol, patent No. 6,410,029) cancer cells. In July 2002, the US Patent and Trademark Office issued to The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System US patent No. 6,410,010. The patent broadly covers all adenoviral p53 compositions (including ADVEXIN), therapeutic and otherwise, that express adequate p53 in amounts sufficient to suppress the growth of or kill cancer cells in patients. The patent also covers adenoviral p53 that incorporates a specific type of promoter that helps cells to express the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Introgen is the exclusive licensee of this composition of matter patent covering ADVEXIN. In December 2002, Aventis Pharmaceuticals was issued US patent No. 6,262,032 B1 entitled \"Method of Destroying Hyperproliferative Cells by Combining p53 and Taxoid Treatment\". Introgen has an exclusive license to this patent and is using this type of combination therapy in its breast cancer trial.

As an activator, p53 relies on its specific consensus sequence within the promoter. It is not clear whether p53 requires a specific DNA binding site in its action as a gene repressor. This report demonstrates that the human BKB1R gene is a p53 target. Expression of p53 in transiently transfected SV40-transformed IMR90 cells strongly suppressed luciferase reporter activity driven by a 1.8 kb BKB1R promoter as well as its minigene. These down-regulations were p53 dose-dependent. p53 reduced both basal and induced promoter activities of the minigene. Expression of p53 abolished the inducibility of the minigene. Induction of endogenous p53 expression by etoposide also inhibited promoter activity and minigene inducibility. Replacing the region containing both the putative p53 binding site and the TATA-box with a basal adenovirus promoter in the 1.8 kb promoter construct did not prevent p53 from inhibiting BKB1R promoter activity. Thus suppression by p53 is not mediated by competition with the TATA-binding protein and is not through interaction with the putative p53-binding site. p53 also does not appear to suppress BKB1R gene expression through interaction with c-Jun which functions in the inducibility of this gene [Yang et al., 2001].", "Authors": ["X Yang", "L Taylor", "P Polgar"], "Title": "p53 down-regulates human bradykinin B1 receptor gene expression.", "PubmedID": "11400161", "Source": "PubMed"}, "cited_by": 3}]
